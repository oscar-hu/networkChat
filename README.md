# networkChat
Real-time chatting with anyone else in the world over a Linode server!

Note: My server is not running 24/7 as this is just a project for fun, so this only works if I set up my server beforehand.

# How to Install
- `git clone https://github.com/oscar-hu/networkChat.git`

# How to Use
- `cd networkChat`
- `python3 client.py`
